19221	0	0	I'm sorry, I can't support that.	Oppose
19222	0	0	No offense, but I don't think that's the way to deal with this.	Oppose
19223	0	0	I don't think that's entirely accurate.	Oppose
19224	0	0	That's a no-go from me.	Oppose
19225	0	0	No, sorry, I don't think that's a good idea.	Oppose
19226	0	0	Sorry, but I have serious reservations about that.	Oppose

19238	0	0	No way, that's not happening.	Oppose
19239	0	0	That's something I just can't support.	Oppose
19240	0	0	I have to speak up, I can't support this idea.	Oppose

19246	0	0	I'm afraid I have to disagree with you on this matter.	Oppose
19247	0	0	I have to object to that plan, I don't think it's a good idea.	Oppose
19248	0	0	That's not how I see it, I have to object.	Oppose

19250	0	0	I'm sorry, that's not acceptable to me.	Oppose
19251	0	0	I'm sorry, but I can't see eye to eye with you on this.	Oppose
19252	0	0	I'm not convinced by your reasoning.	Oppose
19253	0	0	Sorry, but I don't think that's the right thing to do.	Oppose
19254	0	0	That's not quite accurate, from my perspective.	Oppose
19255	0	0	I don't think that's the best course of action, I'm opposed to it.	Oppose
19256	0	0	Sorry, but I don't share your opinion on that matter.	Oppose
19257	0	0	No, that doesn't seem like a logical solution to me.	Oppose
19258	0	0	I'm afraid I have to take a different stance on this.	Oppose
19259	0	0	I'm sorry, but I have to express my opposition on this matter.	Oppose
19260	0	0	That doesn't really make sense to me.	Oppose
19261	0	0	I'm not amenable to your suggestion.	Oppose
19262	0	0	I don't think that's the best way forward.	Oppose
19263	0	0	Actually, I think the opposite is more convincing.	Oppose
19264	0	0	Sorry, but I have to disagree with you on this one.	Oppose
19265	0	0	I disagree with your assessment, sorry.	Oppose
19266	0	0	I don't think that's a wise strategy, sorry.	Oppose
19267	0	0	Absolutely not, that goes against everything I believe in.	Oppose
19268	0	0	Sorry, but I don't think that's the right course of action.	Oppose
19269	0	0	I don't mean to be rude, but that's just not going to work.	Oppose
19270	0	0	That's not the direction I think we should take.	Oppose
19271	0	0	I don't think I can side with that opinion.	Oppose
19272	0	0	That's not really what I had in mind.	Oppose

19288	0	0	Sorry, but I think that's a bad idea.	Oppose
19289	0	0	I don't think that's a valid justification.	Oppose
19290	0	0	That's not true at all.	Oppose
19291	0	0	Sorry, I can't accept that point of view.	Oppose
19292	0	0	That's not my style.	Oppose
19293	0	0	No, I don't think we should proceed with that approach.	Oppose
19294	0	0	No, I don't think that's the right solution.	Oppose
19295	0	0	I'm sorry, but I don't think that's the right move.	Oppose

19303	0	0	Sorry, but I have to speak up against that.	Oppose
19304	0	0	I don't think that's the best course of action, I have to oppose.	Oppose
19305	0	0	I'm sorry, but I can't agree with that.	Oppose
19306	0	0	Actually, I have a different perspective on this matter.	Oppose
19307	0	0	That's not going to work, in my view.	Oppose
19308	0	0	I don't see eye-to-eye with you on this issue.	Oppose

19312	0	0	I have to say, I'm not convinced.	Oppose
19313	0	0	Sorry, but that's not accurate, Tom.	Oppose
19314	0	0	I'm not sure I can get behind that idea, sorry.	Oppose
19315	0	0	That's not what I had in mind, sorry.	Oppose
19316	0	0	Sorry, but I don't want to take part in that.	Oppose
19317	0	0	No, that's not what I'm trying to say.	Oppose
19318	0	0	No, no, and no! That's simply not acceptable.	Oppose
19319	0	0	I don't think I can support your proposal on this.	Oppose
19320	0	0	Sorry, but I can't go there with you.	Oppose
19321	0	0	No, that's definitely not how I look at things.	Oppose
19322	0	0	I'm sorry, but I can't support your plan.	Oppose
19323	0	0	No, that's not an option in my opinion.	Oppose
19324	0	0	I see where you're coming from, but I can't support it.	Oppose
19325	0	0	I have to object to that, sorry.	Oppose
19326	0	0	I'm sorry to disagree, but I think you're wrong about that.	Oppose
19327	0	0	I'm not comfortable with that, so I'll have to say no.	Oppose
19328	0	0	No, that's not what I meant at all.	Oppose
19329	0	0	I have to say no to that proposal, I'm afraid.	Oppose
19330	0	0	I can't agree with that assessment, I'm afraid.	Oppose
19331	0	0	That doesn't sound right to me.	Oppose

19349	0	0	Umm, no, that's not quite right.	Oppose
19350	0	0	I don't think that's a sound strategy, I'm sorry.	Oppose
19351	0	0	This is not what I had in mind.	Oppose
19352	0	0	Sorry, but I have to speak out against that decision.	Oppose
19353	0	0	Absolutely not, that's completely unacceptable.	Oppose
19354	0	0	Sorry, I'm not comfortable with that approach.	Oppose
19355	0	0	No, I don't think so.	Oppose
19356	0	0	No, I don't think that's the right way to go.	Oppose
19357	0	0	I'm not seeing the logic behind your argument.	Oppose
19358	0	0	I can't approve of that decision.	Oppose
19359	0	0	I'm sorry, but I can't support your idea on this matter.	Oppose

19365	0	0	I think we might have to agree to disagree on this one.	Oppose
19366	0	0	Actually, I think you've got it all wrong.	Oppose
19367	0	0	That doesn't sound very feasible to me.	Oppose
19368	0	0	I'm afraid I'm going to have to take issue with that.	Oppose
19369	0	0	That's not how things should be done, in my opinion.	Oppose

19374	0	0	Sorry, but I think you're mistaken.	Oppose
19375	0	0	That's not going to lead us in the right direction, we need to reconsider.	Oppose
19376	0	0	I'm sorry, but I don't think that's ethical.	Oppose
19377	0	0	No, I'm not comfortable with that.	Oppose
19378	0	0	I'm sorry, but I have to be honest, that's not the way I see it.	Oppose

19467	0	0	That's not how I see it, I'm afraid.	Oppose
19468	0	0	I'm sorry, but I think we should go a different direction.	Oppose
19469	0	0	I don't think that policy is fair to everyone.	Oppose
19470	0	0	That’s an interesting point, but it doesn’t persuade me.	Oppose
19471	0	0	Sorry, I have to disagree with you on this one.	Oppose
19472	0	0	Hmm...I'm not quite sold on that.	Oppose
19473	0	0	That's not right, and I cannot support it.	Oppose

19483	0	0	I'm sorry, but I have to challenge your assumption.	Oppose
19484	0	0	That's not something I can support, Olivia.	Oppose
